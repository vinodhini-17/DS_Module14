## AIM:
To write a C function to calculate the turnaround time of each process given their burst time and waiting time in First Come first Serve scheduling algorithm.
## Algorithm
1. 1. Start with process, burst time, and waiting time arrays.
2. Loop through each process from i = 0 to n-1.
3. Compute tat[i] = burst_time[i] + wait_time[i].
4. End the algorithm

## Program:
```
/*
Program to find and display the priority of the operator in the given Postfix expression
Developed by: vinodhini k
RegisterNumber: 212223230245
*/
int turnaroundtime( int proc[], int n,int burst_time[], int wait_time[], int tat[]) {
 // calculating turnaround time by adding
 // burst_time[i] + wait_time[i]
 int i;
 for ( i = 0; i < n ; i++)
 tat[i] = burst_time[i] + wait_time[i];
 return 0;
}

```

## Output:

## Result:
Thus, the C function to calculate the turnaround time of each process given their burst time and waiting time in First Come first Serve scheduling algorithm is implemented successfully.
