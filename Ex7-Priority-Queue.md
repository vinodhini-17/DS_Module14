# Ex7 Priority Queue
## DATE : 26.04.2025
## AIM:
To formulate the C code to display the elements of the priority queue after insertion and deletion operation.

## Algorithm
1. Start and define printArray(array, size).

2. Loop from index 0 to size - 1.

3. During each iteration, print array[i].

4. After loop, print a newline for formatting.

5. End.

## Program:
```

*/
/*#include<stdio.h>
int size = 0;
*/
void printArray(int array[], intsize)
{
int i;
for(i=0;i<size;i++)
{
printf("%d ",array[i]);
}
printf("\n");
}

```

## Output:

## Result:
Thus, the C program to display the elements of the priority queue after insertion and deletion operation is implemented successfully
